## Relationship with AGENT.md

- **IDENTITY.md**: Who the agent is (name, purpose, background)
- **AGENT.md**: How the agent behaves (guidelines, constraints)

Both files work together to define your assistant.

## Best Practices

1. **Define a name** - Makes the agent more personal
2. **State purpose clearly** - What the agent is for
3. **Add personality** - Makes interactions more natural
4. **Keep it concise** - Focus on key aspects
