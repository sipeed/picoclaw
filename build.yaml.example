# Build configuration: control which channels (and optionally providers/tools in the future)
# are compiled into the binary to reduce size. Copy to build.yaml and edit. Used when you run:
#   make build
# (or run: go run ./scripts/genbuild before go build).
#
# See docs/BUILD_CONFIG.md.

channels:
  # Preferred allowlist model: list the channel names you want to include.
  # If empty or omitted, all discovered channels under pkg/channels/ are included.
  #
  # Channel names must match the channel package directory under pkg/channels/.
  include: []
  # include: [telegram, whatsapp, discord, slack, feishu, dingtalk, wecom, qq, line, onebot, maixcam, pico, whatsapp_native]

  # Optional denylist model:
  #   skip: [telegram, whatsapp]
