> **PicoClaw** is an independent open-source project initiated by [Sipeed](https://sipeed.com). It is written entirely in **Go** — not a fork of OpenClaw, NanoBot, or any other project.

🦐 PicoClaw is an ultra-lightweight personal AI Assistant inspired by [NanoBot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), refactored from the ground up in Go through a self-bootstrapping process, where the AI agent itself drove the entire architectural migration and code optimization.

⚡️ Runs on $10 hardware with <10MB RAM: That's 99% less memory than OpenClaw and 98% cheaper than a Mac mini!

## 🖥️ CLI Reference
## ⚙️ Configuration

Config file: `~/.picoclaw/config.json`

### Environment Variables

You can override default paths using environment variables. This is useful for portable installations, containerized deployments, or running picoclaw as a system service. These variables are independent and control different paths.

| Variable          | Description                                                                                                                             | Default Path              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `PICOCLAW_CONFIG` | Overrides the path to the configuration file. This directly tells picoclaw which `config.json` to load, ignoring all other locations. | `~/.picoclaw/config.json` |
| `PICOCLAW_HOME`   | Overrides the root directory for picoclaw data. This changes the default location of the `workspace` and other data directories.          | `~/.picoclaw`             |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run picoclaw using a specific config file
# The workspace path will be read from within that config file
PICOCLAW_CONFIG=/etc/picoclaw/production.json picoclaw gateway

# Run picoclaw with all its data stored in /opt/picoclaw
# Config will be loaded from the default ~/.picoclaw/config.json
# Workspace will be created at /opt/picoclaw/workspace
PICOCLAW_HOME=/opt/picoclaw picoclaw agent

# Use both for a fully customized setup
PICOCLAW_HOME=/srv/picoclaw PICOCLAW_CONFIG=/srv/picoclaw/main.json picoclaw gateway
```

### Workspace Layout

PicoClaw stores data in your configured workspace (default: `~/.picoclaw/workspace`):

```
~/.picoclaw/workspace/
├── sessions/          # Conversation sessions and history
├── memory/           # Long-term memory (MEMORY.md)
├── state/            # Persistent state (last channel, etc.)
├── cron/             # Scheduled jobs database
├── skills/           # Custom skills
├── AGENTS.md         # Agent behavior guide
├── HEARTBEAT.md      # Periodic task prompts (checked every 30 min)
├── IDENTITY.md       # Agent identity
├── SOUL.md           # Agent soul
└── USER.md           # User preferences
```

### Skill Sources

By default, skills are loaded from:

1. `~/.picoclaw/workspace/skills` (workspace)
2. `~/.picoclaw/skills` (global)
3. `<current-working-directory>/skills` (builtin)

For advanced/test setups, you can override the builtin skills root with:

```bash
export PICOCLAW_BUILTIN_SKILLS=/path/to/skills
```

### Unified Command Execution Policy

- Generic slash commands are executed through a single path in `pkg/agent/loop.go` via `commands.Executor`.
- Channel adapters no longer consume generic commands locally; they forward inbound text to the bus/agent path. Telegram still auto-registers supported commands at startup.
- Unknown slash command (for example `/foo`) passes through to normal LLM processing.
- Registered but unsupported command on the current channel (for example `/show` on WhatsApp) returns an explicit user-facing error and stops further processing.
### 🔒 Security Sandbox

PicoClaw runs in a sandboxed environment by default. The agent can only access files and execute commands within the configured workspace.

#### Default Configuration

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "~/.picoclaw/workspace",
      "restrict_to_workspace": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Option                  | Default                 | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `workspace`             | `~/.picoclaw/workspace` | Working directory for the agent           |
| `restrict_to_workspace` | `true`                  | Restrict file/command access to workspace |

#### Protected Tools

When `restrict_to_workspace: true`, the following tools are sandboxed:

| Tool          | Function         | Restriction                            |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `read_file`   | Read files       | Only files within workspace            |
| `write_file`  | Write files      | Only files within workspace            |
| `list_dir`    | List directories | Only directories within workspace      |
| `edit_file`   | Edit files       | Only files within workspace            |
| `append_file` | Append to files  | Only files within workspace            |
| `exec`        | Execute commands | Command paths must be within workspace |

#### Additional Exec Protection

Even with `restrict_to_workspace: false`, the `exec` tool blocks these dangerous commands:

* `rm -rf`, `del /f`, `rmdir /s` — Bulk deletion
* `format`, `mkfs`, `diskpart` — Disk formatting
* `dd if=` — Disk imaging
* Writing to `/dev/sd[a-z]` — Direct disk writes
* `shutdown`, `reboot`, `poweroff` — System shutdown
* Fork bomb `:(){ :|:& };:`

#### Error Examples

```
[ERROR] tool: Tool execution failed
{tool=exec, error=Command blocked by safety guard (path outside working dir)}
```

```
[ERROR] tool: Tool execution failed
{tool=exec, error=Command blocked by safety guard (dangerous pattern detected)}
```

#### Disabling Restrictions (Security Risk)

If you need the agent to access paths outside the workspace:

**Method 1: Config file**

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "restrict_to_workspace": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Method 2: Environment variable**

```bash
export PICOCLAW_AGENTS_DEFAULTS_RESTRICT_TO_WORKSPACE=false
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Disabling this restriction allows the agent to access any path on your system. Use with caution in controlled environments only.

#### Security Boundary Consistency

The `restrict_to_workspace` setting applies consistently across all execution paths:

| Execution Path   | Security Boundary            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Main Agent       | `restrict_to_workspace` ✅   |
| Subagent / Spawn | Inherits same restriction ✅ |
| Heartbeat tasks  | Inherits same restriction ✅ |

All paths share the same workspace restriction — there's no way to bypass the security boundary through subagents or scheduled tasks.

### Heartbeat (Periodic Tasks)

PicoClaw can perform periodic tasks automatically. Create a `HEARTBEAT.md` file in your workspace:

```markdown
# Periodic Tasks

- Check my email for important messages
- Review my calendar for upcoming events
- Check the weather forecast
```

The agent will read this file every 30 minutes (configurable) and execute any tasks using available tools.

#### Async Tasks with Spawn

For long-running tasks (web search, API calls), use the `spawn` tool to create a **subagent**:

```markdown
# Periodic Tasks

## Quick Tasks (respond directly)

- Report current time

## Long Tasks (use spawn for async)

- Search the web for AI news and summarize
- Check email and report important messages
```

**Key behaviors:**

| Feature                 | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **spawn**               | Creates async subagent, doesn't block heartbeat           |
| **Independent context** | Subagent has its own context, no session history          |
| **message tool**        | Subagent communicates with user directly via message tool |
| **Non-blocking**        | After spawning, heartbeat continues to next task          |

#### How Subagent Communication Works

```
Heartbeat triggers
    ↓
Agent reads HEARTBEAT.md
    ↓
For long task: spawn subagent
    ↓                           ↓
Continue to next task      Subagent works independently
    ↓                           ↓
All tasks done            Subagent uses "message" tool
    ↓                           ↓
Respond HEARTBEAT_OK      User receives result directly
```

The subagent has access to tools (message, web_search, etc.) and can communicate with the user independently without going through the main agent.

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "heartbeat": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 30
  }
}
```

| Option     | Default | Description                        |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `enabled`  | `true`  | Enable/disable heartbeat           |
| `interval` | `30`    | Check interval in minutes (min: 5) |

**Environment variables:**

* `PICOCLAW_HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=false` to disable
* `PICOCLAW_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=60` to change interval

### Providers

> [!NOTE]
> Groq provides free voice transcription via Whisper. If configured, audio messages from any channel will be automatically transcribed at the agent level.

### Model Configuration (model_list)

> **What's New?** PicoClaw now uses a **model-centric** configuration approach. Simply specify `vendor/model` format (e.g., `zhipu/glm-4.7`) to add new providers—**zero code changes required!**

This design also enables **multi-agent support** with flexible provider selection:

- **Different agents, different providers**: Each agent can use its own LLM provider
- **Model fallbacks**: Configure primary and fallback models for resilience
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple endpoints
- **Centralized configuration**: Manage all providers in one place

#### 📋 All Supported Vendors

#### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "model_list": [
    {
      "model_name": "ark-code-latest",
      "model": "volcengine/ark-code-latest",
      "api_key": "sk-your-api-key"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "gpt-5.4",
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
      "api_key": "sk-your-openai-key"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
      "api_key": "sk-ant-your-key"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "glm-4.7",
      "model": "zhipu/glm-4.7",
      "api_key": "your-zhipu-key"
    }
  ],
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "gpt-5.4"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Vendor-Specific Examples

**OpenAI**

```json
{
  "model_name": "gpt-5.4",
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "api_key": "sk-..."
}
```

**VolcEngine (Doubao)**

```json
{
  "model_name": "ark-code-latest",
  "model": "volcengine/ark-code-latest",
  "api_key": "sk-..."
}
```

**智谱 AI (GLM)**

```json
{
  "model_name": "glm-4.7",
  "model": "zhipu/glm-4.7",
  "api_key": "your-key"
}
```

**DeepSeek**

```json
{
  "model_name": "deepseek-chat",
  "model": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
  "api_key": "sk-..."
}
```

**Anthropic (with API key)**

```json
{
  "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
  "api_key": "sk-ant-your-key"
}
```

> Run `picoclaw auth login --provider anthropic` to paste your API token.

**Anthropic Messages API (native format)**

For direct Anthropic API access or custom endpoints that only support Anthropic's native message format:

```json
{
  "model_name": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "model": "anthropic-messages/claude-opus-4-6",
  "api_key": "sk-ant-your-key",
  "api_base": "https://api.anthropic.com"
}
```

> Use `anthropic-messages` protocol when:
> - Using third-party proxies that only support Anthropic's native `/v1/messages` endpoint (not OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`)
> - Connecting to services like MiniMax, Synthetic that require Anthropic's native message format
> - The existing `anthropic` protocol returns 404 errors (indicating the endpoint doesn't support OpenAI-compatible format)
>
> **Note:** The `anthropic` protocol uses OpenAI-compatible format (`/v1/chat/completions`), while `anthropic-messages` uses Anthropic's native format (`/v1/messages`). Choose based on your endpoint's supported format.

**Ollama (local)**

```json
{
  "model_name": "llama3",
  "model": "ollama/llama3"
}
```

**Custom Proxy/API**

```json
{
  "model_name": "my-custom-model",
  "model": "openai/custom-model",
  "api_base": "https://my-proxy.com/v1",
  "api_key": "sk-...",
  "request_timeout": 300
}
```

**LiteLLM Proxy**

```json
{
  "model_name": "lite-gpt4",
  "model": "litellm/lite-gpt4",
  "api_base": "http://localhost:4000/v1",
  "api_key": "sk-..."
}
```

PicoClaw strips only the outer `litellm/` prefix before sending the request, so proxy aliases like `litellm/lite-gpt4` send `lite-gpt4`, while `litellm/openai/gpt-4o` sends `openai/gpt-4o`.

#### Load Balancing

Configure multiple endpoints for the same model name—PicoClaw will automatically round-robin between them:

```json
{
  "model_list": [
    {
      "model_name": "gpt-5.4",
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
      "api_base": "https://api1.example.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-key1"
    },
    {
      "model_name": "gpt-5.4",
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
      "api_base": "https://api2.example.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-key2"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Migration from Legacy `providers` Config

The old `providers` configuration is **deprecated** but still supported for backward compatibility.

**Old Config (deprecated):**

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "zhipu": {
      "api_key": "your-key",
      "api_base": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "provider": "zhipu",
      "model": "glm-4.7"
    }
  }
}
```

**New Config (recommended):**

```json
{
  "model_list": [
    {
      "model_name": "glm-4.7",
      "model": "zhipu/glm-4.7",
      "api_key": "your-key"
    }
  ],
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "glm-4.7"
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed migration guide, see [docs/migration/model-list-migration.md](docs/migration/model-list-migration.md).

### Provider Architecture

PicoClaw routes providers by protocol family:

- OpenAI-compatible protocol: OpenRouter, OpenAI-compatible gateways, Groq, Zhipu, and vLLM-style endpoints.
- Anthropic protocol: Claude-native API behavior.
- Codex/OAuth path: OpenAI OAuth/token authentication route.

This keeps the runtime lightweight while making new OpenAI-compatible backends mostly a config operation (`api_base` + `api_key`).

### Scheduled Tasks / Reminders

PicoClaw supports scheduled reminders and recurring tasks through the `cron` tool:

* **One-time reminders**: "Remind me in 10 minutes" → triggers once after 10min
* **Recurring tasks**: "Remind me every 2 hours" → triggers every 2 hours
* **Cron expressions**: "Remind me at 9am daily" → uses cron expression
