ClawDroid is an Android AI assistant with an embedded Go backend. Install the APK, launch, and start chatting — no separate server setup needed.

A Kotlin/Jetpack Compose app provides the chat UI, voice assistant, and device automation. The Go backend runs as a single binary bundled inside the APK, handling the agent loop, tool execution, LLM calls, and messaging channels.

<b>Features:</b>

* Chat UI built with Jetpack Compose
* Floating assistant overlay — replace Google Assistant with long-press home
* Voice mode — continuous conversation loop (listen, send, think, speak)
* Device automation — tap, swipe, text input, screenshot via AccessibilityService
* 16+ built-in tools — file operations, web search, memory, cron, sub-agents, MCP
* Multi-channel messaging — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, LINE
* 10+ LLM providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, and more
* Long-term memory and daily notes
* Scheduled tasks with cron expressions
* MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support
* Customizable personality via workspace files

<b>Two editions:</b>

* Embedded — Go backend bundled in the APK, works out of the box
* Termux — Run the Go backend separately in Termux for advanced users

Requires an LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) to function.
